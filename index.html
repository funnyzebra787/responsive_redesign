          Have you ever walked into a fast food restaurant, saw a long line, and then saw an ordering kiosk nearby? Did you walk to the kiosk, thinking it would be faster to order here?
          Then you play around with the interface and eventually get to placing your order? Then you realize that I would have been faster just to order at the counter?
          Then when you try to pick up your order, you don't know where to pick it up? In this project, I took a deep dive
          into the tablet ordering interface at Ten One Tea House in Providence, RI. I wanted to learn about why people use
          the interface, who typically uses the interface, why the interface is good/bad, and more relating to the user journey
          for this specific interface. I learned many interesting things along the way, so keep reading on!

          <b>Caption:</b>
          This interface is trying to solve the problem of long lines ordering at the counter in the store. If a
          customer wants to avoid a line or just avoid talking their order to the cashier and potentially
          miscommunicating. The key components are the menu, in which the user selects what item they want to add
          to cart. Then the user can customize the item. Then the user can checkout their cart, review the order/add tip,
          and pay using the card reader below the screen.

          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            No line at counter, and she walked directly to the ordering screen. Walked in with a friend who ordered
            after her.
          </li>
          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Very decisive when ordering, she seemed like she knew exactly what she wanted and had ordered here before.
          </li>
          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Found item pretty quickly, and didn't hesitate much on item customization screen. Only made 2 customizations.
          </li>
          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Added to cart and went to checkout screen. Quickly selected No tip. Then typed in phone number smoothly,
            although it seemed like for a second she wanted to skip the phone number part.
          </li>
          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Paid using Apple Pay, but phone wasn't recognizing for a few
            seconds so user had to retry again.
          </li>

          <b style="font-size: 22px">USER 2:</b>
          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Also no line at the counter, and user came in alone. Looked at the menu hanging on the wall to the left for
            a few seconds, and then proceeded to the ordering screen.
          </li>
          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Scrolled down to the "milk tea" section, manually scrolled and didn't click on the tab at the top. User added
            it to cart, but then removed it after looking at the customization screen.
          </li>

          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Then scrolled manually to the "fresh fruit tea" section and added a different item to cart. Hesitated
            a bit on the customization screen.
          </li>

          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Seemed unsure about customization part, unlike user1 who was very decisive.
          </li>

          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Added to cart and went to checkout screen. Thought about tip for a second and then selected No tip.
            Tried to skip phone number page but realized you couldn't, so then typed in phone number. Paid with Apple Pay.
          </li>

          <b style="font-size: 22px">USER 3:</b>
          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            One person was ordering at the counter, and user came in with two other friends. Talked with friends for a bit
            then went to ordering screen.
          </li>
          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Slowly and manually scrolled down to the "summer special" section, clicked on an item and added it to cart.
            Looked at a few other items while scrolling.
          </li>

          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Hesitated a bit on the customization screen and clicked multiple selections before settling on one. Was also
            talking to friend at the same time.
          </li>

          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            A bit unsure about customization part similar to user2, and not as decisive as user1.
          </li>

          <li class="non-spaced-bullets">
            Added to cart and went to checkout screen. Thought about tip for a second and then selected $2.
            Typed in phone number. Paid with Apple Pay, but again the card reader was a bit slow.

        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Card reader with apple pay was a bit iffy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Felt like there were some unnecessary pages such as phone number, tip, claim points.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slightly too many "optional" customizations that they didn't want and cluttered the customization screen a bit.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <b>2)</b>
          What was your thought process when you walked into the store and wanted to order something?
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Probably faster to order on screen and get the order exactly right
          </li>
          <li>
            Didn't feel like talking to the person at the counter who seemed busy making a drink.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <b>3)</b>
          How did prior experience using this interface, or the lack thereof, affect your experience using the interface?
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Used it before, definitely made it faster to use because knew what screens and buttons to expect.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the one didn't use before, probably would be faster experience if familiar with beforehand.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <b>4)</b>
          Can you describe how the people around you affected or didn't affect how you used the interface?
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tried not to take too long since my friend needed to order after me.
          </li>
          <li>
            Didn't really care since I was alone.
